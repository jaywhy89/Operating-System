This directory currently provides four tests.

All tests send their output to a file. They print a PASS when this output file
matches the expected output file, or else they print FAIL.

For example, the test_rw test describe below sends it output to the test_rw.out
file and its expected output is in the test_rw.txt file.

1. test_rw

This reads and writes to direct and indirect blocks but at multi-block
granularity. It will pass once multi-block read/write is implemented.

2. test_rw_large

This tests reads and writes via the double indirect block.

3. test_rw_too_big

This tests writes beyond the maximum file size. Note that the way the test is
setup, the file size will increase because a partial write occurs (but the file
size should not become larger than the maximum file size).

4. test_rw_no_space

This tests for writes when the file system is full.
